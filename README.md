 Mobile App for Reservation
 
In the reservation application where we worked as a group for our final homework at school, I mainly worked actively on the user side. I contributed in the code that logs the user in and out of the app and connect it to Google Firebase. I understood the working logic of Firebase. We exchanged ideas about the application with my teammates on the business side and helped with the issues we were stuck with. We developed as a team on the basis of Android Studio and Google Firebase in our project, which we created in a period of about 1 month. Finally, we delivered with our project report.
